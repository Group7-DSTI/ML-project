# English Quality Prediction Project

## Overview

This project revolves around predicting the quality of English essays using a dataset comprising 7000+ meticulously graded essays by specialists. Tackling real-world challenges, the project involves extensive cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) for robust feature engineering. The primary objective is to develop a sophisticated Natural Language Processing (NLP) solution that serves as the cornerstone for an English program at Easy Sailing Language Training. The company's overarching mission is to construct a tool capable of evaluating the English writing proficiency of new students. This tool, aligned with the IELTS grading system, aids prospective students in gauging the necessary time investment to ascend to the next proficiency level.

## Project Scope

### Problem Statement
The project aims to construct an end-to-end pipeline capable of processing essays and assigning a grade that effectively communicates the level of English proficiency. Exploring additional libraries such as Spacy, NLTK, scikit-learn, and HuggingFace is highly encouraged to augment the project's capabilities.

### Reframing Options
In the event of challenges arising during dataset analysis, there is the option to reframe the problem as a classification task (e.g., poor, average, great).

## Project Objectives

1. **Data Exploration:**
   - Conduct thorough exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain a comprehensive understanding of the dataset.
   - Address challenges related to data cleaning and preprocessing.

2. **Feature Engineering and Selection:**
   - Engineer pertinent features that significantly contribute to the model's predictive capability.
   - Thoughtfully select features that enhance overall model performance.

3. **Model Training and Evaluation:**
   - Train a model using the provided dataset to predict essay ratings.
   - Evaluate the model's performance using relevant metrics.

4. **Deployment:**
   - Develop a deployable solution that seamlessly integrates the trained model into an end-to-end pipeline.
